# Spatial Multitasking

This project implements and compares three spatial multitasking algorithms for scheduling tasks across multiple cores:
- **Cooperative Algorithm**: This baseline algorithm equally distributes tasks across available cores.
- **Best Algorithm**: Optimizes for makespan, energy consumption, and peak power, aiming to improve performance and resource utilization.
- **Profile Algorithm**: Maximizes the aggregated speedup for task execution across cores.

## Features
- **Task Scheduling Simulation**: Visual representation of task scheduling across cores for different multitasking algorithms.
- **Performance Metrics**: Comparison of makespan and energy consumption for various algorithms across increasing numbers of tasks.
- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Highlights the trade-offs between different algorithms with respect to energy and makespan performance.

## Plots
The following visualizations are generated by the project:

### Task Schedule
The plots below shows the distribution of tasks across six cores over time. Each color represents a different task, providing a clear overview of how tasks are scheduled and executed on each core.

### Makespan vs Number of Tasks
This plot shows the makespan (total time to complete all tasks) for different algorithms as the number of tasks increases. The Cooperative Algorithm has a lower makespan for fewer tasks, but the Best Algorithm becomes more efficient as tasks increase. The Profile Algorithm, although designed to maximize speedup.

### Energy vs Number of Tasks
This plot highlights the energy consumption for each algorithm as the number of tasks increases. The Cooperative Algorithm is more energy-efficient with fewer tasks, but the Best Algorithm demonstrates better energy optimization as task numbers rise.
